# My Approach
This is the course which is the actually the most feared and discussed course in first semester. You will see plenty of people getting scared of this course. 
But this is truly the most beautiful course of all. You will definitely fall in love with this course once you understand this. It's really easy to score in exam. Many people got 20 out of 20. I myself got it despite having no CS background.
To be honest, there was no middle ground in this course during my time. People either failed or achieved 17-20. Follow my suggested guidlines, you shall do good by God's grace.

There are usually two exams - One on Turing Machine(Cancelled during my time) and other on Complexity. Most people pass in the first test and fail in the second. 
But you can score pretty good on the second test. In the second test, there is only one decison problem A (divided into 6-7 questions). The problem will be explained there (e.g MAX CUT, HAMITONIAN GRAPH, 3-SET).
The main topic of the exam is to prove that the given problem A is NP-Complete. Now to prove that a decision problem A is NP-Complete. You need to prove two things.

1. A is NP-Hard ( By showing that the a known NP-Hard problem B can be reduced polynomially to A. Means if we ever find the solution of B in polynomial time, we can find the solution of A also in polynomial time and vice-versa)
2. A is in NP ( This is actually 2-3 lines proof). To prove that a problem is in NP, just take an example and say how polynomially you can verify whether it's a solution of the problem or not. For example, you can't write a code which solves Suduku in polynomial time but if I give you a filled suduku problem , you can verify whether the filled example is actually a valid suduku solution or not. This is what you need to write in mathematical way.

Your main way of proceeding towards this course is to learn reduction (Remember: Professor will already tell you what to reduce and even how to reduce).
Some of the reduction I have studied.
1. HC to TSP
2. 3-SAT to CLIQUE
3. INDSET to CLIQUE
4. 3 SAT to INDSET
5. 3-SAT to VERTEX COVER  
6. 3-SAT to GRAPH K COLORABILITY
7. 3-SAT to NAESAT
8. 3-SAT to DOMINATING SET
9. 3-SAT to NAE-4-SET
10. NAE-4-SAT to NAE-3-SAT
