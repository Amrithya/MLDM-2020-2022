The article analyses the performance of KNN on Waveforms dataset. We compare the empirical risks of the model by experimenting with various values of k (neighbors) and estimate of the true risk using Cross-Validation. We also analyse the effect of training sample size in bias-variance trade-off and present the reduction of training dataset using CNN and RNN. Finally we generate artificial imbalancy in dataset and compare the performance.
