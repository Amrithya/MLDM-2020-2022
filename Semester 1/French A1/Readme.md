# My journey

There are no words to describe how beautiful and poetic this language is. 
I was in A1 and my course instructor was Delphine mam. If you are in the same class, know that it's really an interesting course once you are engaging. 
Delphine mam is really patient and caring towards her students and the exam was really easy.
